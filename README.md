# Rick and Morty API Demo Showcase

This project provides a complete showcase of a GraphQL application aimed at comparing classical REST with GraphQL and demonstrating GraphQL's capabilities. It comprises several different pods that can be spun up in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Requirements

1. A running Kubernetes cluster
2. Helm

## Components to Run

1. **[Istio](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/helm/)** + **[Kiali](https://kiali.io/)** + **[Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/)** to collect distributed traces and data for benchmarking.
2. **MongoDB** to store data for the application.
3. **Ariadne**: A Python microservice built on the Ariadne GraphQL framework to showcase a simple authentication mechanism.
4. **Ariadnews**: A Python microservice built on the Ariadne GraphQL framework.
5. **Rick-and-Morty-API**: A Node.js microservice built on the open-source [Rick and Morty API](https://github.com/afuh/rick-and-morty-api).
6. **WunderGraph**: Files to spin up [Cosmo WunderGraph](https://wundergraph.com/), an open-source alternative for creating GraphQL federation that combines our three GraphQL APIs, allowing access from a single endpoint.
